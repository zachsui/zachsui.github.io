### My beliefs as a Software Engineer

- **Any codebase should come with some documentation, at least documentation that describes what it does and gets it up and running.** This is a lifesaver. I frequently find myself thanking me in the past for writing docs.

- **Pushing for automation whenever I find myself doing something repeatedly** - because this is a strong sign that a computer can do it for me - and with less likelihood of making an error. **Automate everything** is my philosophy, I love leveraging automation technics like Selenium, Jenkins, Docker, Jenkins and AWS.

- Tests **NEED** maintenance. A lesson taught by one of my mentors at my final internship, which rang true over time. Going excessive with tests likely means that a lot of tests have to updated during major refactorings.

### My Life

Me and my family are living in Virginia, in my spare time we will visit museums in Washington, D.C., my favorite one is The East Building of [National Gallery of Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gallery_of_Art). We really enjoy searching yummy foods near DMV area, you can also find me hiking many of the beautiful trails at [Shenandoah National Park](https://www.nps.gov/shen/index.htm).
