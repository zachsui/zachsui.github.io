Hi there, my name is Zach Sui. I am currently working as a Staff Software Engineer at [Okta](https://www.okta.com) since July 2021. Before joining Okta, I was working as a Lead Automation Engineer at [Cvent](https://www.cvent.com) from Feb 2016 to July 2021, Associate Softwaare Engineer at [The Advisory Board Company](https://www.advisory.com/) from July 2015 to Jan 2016.

I earned my Master degree in Electrical Computer Engineering from [The State University of New York, University at Buffalo](https://www.buffalo.edu/) in 2015, and I earned my Bachlor degree in Electrical Information Engineering from [Beijing University of Technology](https://www.bjut.edu.cn/) in 2013. After undergraduate study, I worked as a intern at [Datang Telecom Technology](https://www.datang.com/) for 6 months.
