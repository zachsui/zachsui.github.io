This is a <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cloud-dev-ops-nanodegree--nd9991">Nanodegree Program</a> provided by Udacity. During this program, I learned to design and deploy infrastructure as code, build and monitor CI/CD pipelines for different deployment strategies, and deployed scalable microservices using Kubernetes. At the end of the program, I also combineed my new skills by completing a capstone project. See below for more details. :sparkles: :smile:

***

#### What I learned
<ul>
    <li>Cloud Foundations</li>
</ul>

Learn the fundamentals of cloud computing while being introduced to compute power, security, storage, networking, messaging, and management services in the cloud.

***

<ul>
    <li>Deploy Infrastructure as Code (IAC)</li>
</ul>

In this course, you’ll learn how to deploy the underlying infrastructure components that provide security and services to our servers by writing scripts using CloudFormation, AWS’ tool for Infrastructure as Code. You will use CloudFormation to deploy Infrastructure patterns that are used in the industry broadly and can be readily used to deploy any cloud application. Like in the real world, you will begin with initial business requirements that you will turn into Cloud Architecture Diagrams. Then you will deploy this architecture using CloudFormation.

***

<ul>
    <li>Build CI/CD Pipelines, Monitoring & Logging</li>
</ul>

Learn how to stretch for Continuous Delivery as your “true north” while you build CI/CD systems that automate the “stuff” between developers and the cloud. You’ll gain essential knowledge and put it into practice as you learn about Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. You’ll combine your existing knowledge of Cloud Formation and AWS with new tools like Ansible and Circle CI. You’ll also learn how to keep an eye on your deployments with proactive monitoring and alerting.


***

<ul>
    <li>Microservices at Scale using Kubernetes</li>
</ul>

In this course, you learn to create and deploy a kubernetes cluster, configure kubernetes autoscale and load test a kubernetes application. You’ll learn to operationalize both existing and new microservices and apply containers best practices. You’ll learn to deploy Machine Learning microservices that are elastic and fault tolerant. You’ll learn to pick the appropriate abstraction for microservices: Serverless (AWS Lambda) or Container Orchestration (Kubernetes).
